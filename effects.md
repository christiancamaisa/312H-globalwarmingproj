# Effects

The 2015 Paris Climate Agreement set two goals for the international community. Countries pledged to keep global temperature change "well below" +2°C and make every effort possible to keep it below 1.5°C. Keeping the global climate below +1.5°C is the "real" goal, which will minimize damage, while +2°C is the worst-case scenario. Here, we will explore the effects of global warming at both of these levels as well as what we already see in the present day (2020).

### Present-Day
As of the time of this writing, 2020 is already halfway underway, and scientists are projecting there is a [75% chance of being the warmest ever on record](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2020/04/21/earth-warmest-year-likely-2020/). It's not only this year, however. We have been setting record upon record for temperatures happen over the past few decades, and the effects of climate change are not something new. The Arctic has been warming at alarming rates since the mid-1990s, with its ocean absorbing much more heat than other regions. Global ice sheets and glaciers have been melting for decades, with many having already disappeared. [The NASA-compiled Arctic Sea Ice Minimum index](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/arctic-sea-ice/) found that the region's ice is declining at 12.85% per decade, a rate that is only poised to increase exponentially through the next few years.

The effects aren't isolated to the world's coldest regions. Farmers are already facing difficulties with their crops' fertility due to the increase in global average temperatures. Many species are having their habitats disrupted and [forced to move further from the equator](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2017/04/climate-change-species-migration-disease/). Global precipitation levels have increased, and weather patterns disrupted, resulting in more pronounced weather events like hurricanes and tropical storms.


### Future Effects
The United Nations published a report in 2018 titled "Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C," which detailed the likely effects we would face at levels of both +1.5°C and +2°C. The study is noted for finding that keeping global warming levels below +1.5°C is possible, but would require "rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society." Importantly, it also stated that humanity would need to reduce its emissions of C02 by 45% by 2030 and reach net-zero at 2050 to stay below the 1.5°C target. As for the 2°C target, we would need to lower our emissions by 25% by 2030 and reach net-zero in 2070.

The report also made key differentiation between 1.5°C and 2°C, stating that limiting global warming to 1.5°C would "reduce the challenging impacts on ecosystems, human health, and well-being." It stated that if humanity were to reach levels of 2°C, there would be profound effects on ecosystems and agriculture, more exacerbated weather, among other impacts. Since we are not at those levels now, we have no way of knowing *exactly* what the impacts will be at 2°C, but one thing is for sure. The actions we take today will have a profound effect on our futures.
