# What's Next

The world's increasing reliance on fossil fuels means we emit a staggering amount of emissions, and those emissions pose a grave threat to our survival. But what *actually* needs to get done?

Just a few decades ago, humanity was mostly unaware of the grave dangers that greenhouse gasses posed to its very existence. Before we knew it, our world was dependent on them for nearly everything, and at times it can seem too late. Despite the horrifying numbers and predictions, it isn't too late to dampen its effects. Drastic action needs to be immediately taken by world governments (specifically developing nations) to prevent and restrict the release of harmful toxins into the atmosphere.

### Where do we start?
One of the best things to visualize what action needs to be taken to stop global warming is the carbon budget. 

The most commonly referred-to version of the budget is the one which was outlined in the Paris Accord in 2015. Nearly every country agreed to hold the global average temperature at or 1.5°C above "pre-industrial" averages.

As the graph above shows, we will need to drastically reduce our emissions within the next few years to meet this goal. Although efforts to combat this warming are helping, they are currently nowhere near where they need to be. What seems to be a more plausible goal is the 2°C budget. Although not optimal, this gives countries ample time to react and respond to the crisis. Drastic cuts in nonrenewables like oil and natural gas [will need to be made ](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report)within this decade to stay on track for this more lenient budget.

This carbon budget of 2 degrees seems more plausible now that we start looking at it. Alas, things are easier said than done. There will have to be a massive international cooperative push to limit the uses of fossil fuels. Given that many developing nations are reliant on them for economic development in one form or another, it will be a challenge to be sure, and enforcing it no easy task.

At the Paris Accords, nearly every country agreed that drastic action is necessary, but there's a catch. Many western countries pointed the finger at developing nations, and vice versa. The developed western countries argued that they have made enough effort to stop climate change, and that developing countries which have higher rates of pollution be the ones to take the most action. The developing nations claim the only current way to prosperity is inherently going to pollute the environment, and that it is unfair for developed western countries to try and point the finger when they are guilty of the same acts. 

This is a very simplified version of the geopolitical barrier to climate action. I recommend this excellent video which illustrates the issue very well and goes more in-depth on the topic.

### Realistic Expectations
Many of the changes that have to come about to counter global warming seem drastic, and it would be false to say they aren't. We are not able to control some areas, but we, as a society, should do everything in our power to change what we can. This includes things like the elimination of coal and fossil fuels in first-world nations and helping those who are developing to develop a reliance on sustainable energy sources.


### What can we (as individuals) do?
Carbon taxes will need to be imposed. New methods of sustainable transport will need to be popularized, and the global agriculture industry will have to figure out ways to reduce their emissions (I'm looking at you, cattle). Again, we are starting to see some movement in the right direction, but ultimately, it is up to our leaders to enforce and propel these initiatives forward. Electing people into public positions that are aware of the issue and can address them is paramount, starting with your vote. Personal adjustments, although they may seem insignificant, are also great ways to combat global warming. Use public transportation when you can, eat less beef products, and reduce your overall footprint through thoughtful lifestyle choices.
