# Background

As most of us know, global warming is one of the most significant issues facing our society today. It presents a fundamental threat to humanity's existence and solving it is a challenge due to our dependence on unsustainable energy.

### How did we get here?

Global warming has not always been an issue for humanity. Although we have been using fire (which emits C02 and other harmful gasses) for upwards of a million years(1), the recent widespread use of fossil fuels and gasses for industrial use has dramatically increased our levels of C02 emittance and pollution of the atmosphere. More specifically, many technological advancements in transportation and extraction have made these nonrenewable sources of energy very cheap. So much so that many have been able to incorporate them into their products/goods/services.

As we see in the graph above, global emissions have rapidly increased over the last 100 years as demand for manufacturing and cheap energy sources has grown exponentially. 

There are many sources of harmful emissions, such as transportation, agriculture, and energy, to name a few. The main takeaway here is that the development of the modern world has led to an intense reliance on unsustainable resources across the board. This is due to the efficiencies and advancements that have made them ultra-cheap.

Because society was not aware of the dangers of fossil fuels in the mid-20th century, when global interdependence was taking root, we became reliant on these harmful sources of energy. With the world's current dominant economic system being capitalism, many corporations have and are incentivized to utilize the cheapest materials and manufacturing processes to maximize profit and revenue margins.


### The Push for Outsourcing
Society's reliance on fossil fuels came about around the same time as widespread outsourcing. Wealthier countries such as the United States turned to countries like China, who manufactured their goods and services for much cheaper. To achieve these prices, producers heavily utilized fossil fuels and other unsustainable resources. This was great for the Western consumers' wallet, but not precisely for the environment. The use of harmful resources and toxins by manufacturers in developing nations also has been detrimental to local populations. Countries like China and India consistently top the charts in terms of air pollution, and the effects clearly show. Many manufacturing hotspots report increased rates of lung cancer and other respiratory diseases directly caused by air pollution (citation needed). 


Again, manufacturing is not the *only* cause of global warming. A large portion of it comes from other sources as well:

The above chart, produced by the United States EPA, shows just how diverse the contributors to global warming are. Agriculture is responsible for a significant piece of the pie, with beef production historically being a notorious contributor. A [paper by Chatham House](https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/field/field_document20141203LivestockClimateChangeForgottenSectorBaileyFroggattWellesleyFinal.pdf), a British geopolitical research organization, states, "Greenhouse gas emissions from the livestock sector are estimated to account for 14.5 percent of the global total, more than direct emissions from the transport sector."(4) You heard that right -- global livestock emissions are more significant than those of the entire transport sector. As silly as it may seem, methane emissions from cow flatulence is a huge problem that only is getting larger as we speak. A rapidly growing world population means a rapidly growing demand for meat.

Global Deforestation and habitat destruction don't help either, with the increasing population and demand for cheap food forcing farmers in Latin America and the rest of the world to cut down rainforests and destroy many animals' homes to meet demand. From the surface, it may seem that this does not have an enormous impact on the climate crisis, while, in reality, it does. The trees in these rainforests which are being actively destroyed are vital for carbon absorption, and their destruction doesn't just mean the lost absorption capacity. The majority of a tree's mass is from the carbon that it has absorbed for (in some cases) centuries, meaning that trees are essentially a physical representation of our carbon emissions. When a tree is cut down and killed, that concentrated carbon is slowly released back into the environment.

In summary, global emissions have reached all-time highs due to the increasing demand for cheap energy, products, food, and transportation. The proliferation of fossil fuels has led to an overwhelming dependence on their existence for many of our conveniences in modern-day life. Identifying the sources of emissions and pollution is the first step in reducing our footprint as a society.
